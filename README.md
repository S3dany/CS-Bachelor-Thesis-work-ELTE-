**An Algorithm to Minimize International Transaction Fees using Graph Theory - Case study on the World Bankâ€™s data on Bilateral Remittance Matrices.**

My thesis work is an approach to minimize the foreign transaction fees in a network of
foreign transactions using graph theory and network flows concepts and algorithms.

I am trying to develop an analysis model that can receive a network of foreign transactions and analyses it to
check if there exist set of foreign transactions to be replaced by local transactions without affecting
the money balances of all the parties of the network. 

My main topic is developing and documenting the model and creating a demo web application that can perform the model procedure on a specific
type of data and store the outcomes. Additionally, to test the model on a network that includes a
large number of nodes. I am adding a simple case study on the world bank remittances data where
I run the model through the application and generate a report of the analysis as an example of what
the algorithm can do.

The web application is developed in Python Django framework for the backend and
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. I have chosen Bootstrap and Bootswatch themes to
develop a nice responsive user interface. Additionally, I used Highcharts JavaScript library to
visualize the output data.

For a brief demonstration of the algorithm and Django demo web app please watch the project presentation:
